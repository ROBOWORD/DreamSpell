The Dreamspell is an esoteric calendar based on a modern interpretation of the Maya calendar by New Age spiritualist, Mayanist philosopher, and author José Argüelles, in 1987.

<P>In 2005 (Blue Crystal Storm), I received a copy of a DreamSpell calendar 
from our local food co-op in Olympia. This began quite an interesting journey 
as, being a computer programmer with a degree in English literature, 
I had finally found a "system" that could be used to help understand or 
explain or better yet to model life experience. 

<P>I have always been interested in nature, numbers and colors. I
remember my favorite discussion during a high-school English class, a
substitute teacher brought a college-level lecture on the usage of
color in The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald. As my brother
says, I have a "poetical" relationship with numbers. And
while growing up, I wanted to be a naturalist after being immersed
and inspired by the wonderful children's books my parents provided 
and growing up spending so much time outside. 

<P>This is a DreamSpell application for the Android, inspired and
adapted from many resources, primarily and materially from Star
Root's amazing DreamSpell Oracle. Credit goes to all who have created
and prepared the way (I am quite positive this list is incomplete,
but it is a start, look for updates and/or please contact me if you

<H2>A Note Regarding DreamSpell, Oracles and Divination Systems in
General</H2>
<P><I>&quot;The Mayan DreamSpell calendar by Jose Arguelles is based
on the Mayan Tzolkin.&quot; - Orion kin 66</I> 

<P>In the interest of full disclosure and in respect of openness, it
is appropriate to provide the following links to quality critiques of
the DreamSpell calendar system:

<P>I think it is reasonable and worthwhile to call out this quote
from the above &quot;Fallacies&quot; link, which summarizes nicely
the issues:

letters since 1992): </I>

	<LI><I>Realized that it was

	<LI><I>Believed they had been

</OL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>I think that the above reasons for abandoning DreamSpell are all
potentially legitimate, but also I think this is perhaps good advice
for anyone wishing to employ a system of oracular or divinational
energies. I think these issues are really related to an individual's
ability to discern and prioritize information; i.e. don't believe
everything you read on the Internet - same goes for reading fortune
cookies, tea leaves, chicken bones and guts, I Ching, pendulums,
tarot, astrology or even Wooji boards. The magic of a divination
system lies within your special relationship as both participant and
observer with the energy of the Universe. Quantum Physics describes
the Uncertainty Principle, that is, the inability to simultaneously
know the velocity and direction of a particle; the secret to your
relationship with an oracle lies within the uncertainty, it is your
responsibility and obligation to filter out and discover what
resonates with you, regardless of which source the message is coming
from. Holding or pinning down to factual accuracies, that is to
'ensure certainty', removes the source of mystery which is the source
of the oracle. 

<P>While the first point, non-alignment with traditional Mayan day-count, is
obviously the largest factual/accuracy hurdle to overcome, I think it
can be balanced by correctly framing the intent and purpose of the
DreamSpell calendar - which is to say, <I>not</I> as a direct
translation or replacement of the Mayan Calendar, for which it is
obviously not, but to me, it is a companion learning tool akin to training
wheels, to help a single-dimensional Gregorian Calendar mindset to
begin to develop the capacity to think in dualistic terms (i.e. solar
<I>and</I> lunar, zero <I>and</I> one, etc.), reflecting a more natural order of reality.
<P>
DreamSpell makes a compromise with the traditional Mayan day-count to
make it more accessible to Western minds,  to whom seeing this kind
of system integrated within our own daily calender could and can
unlock opportunities.  I also suspect that DreamSpell, even though
while using a perpetual calendar template, will in fact become less
necessary or useful as we evolve past the point of needing it, which
I think is original intent of Dr. José Argüelles – that is to
best prepare us for this time of transition we are all living
through.
<P>
By saying that because DreamSpell does not meet this unmandated
requirement to adhere 100% to the Mayan day-count, that it has no
intrinsic value is missing the point and simply throwing the baby out
with the bath water. The true strength in DreamSpell, or any other
oracle or divination system is the capacity for which it unlocks our
stored verbal library of collective historical psychological information. These
systems are more interesting in the dynamics they describe than in
the concreteness of when and where and what and how, but instead,
much more interesting is to focus on why or why not or even seeking
inspiration for action or non-action. But ultimately, the
responsibility for this relationship rests with the individual,
ultimately the Universe wishes you to be happy and will provide and
be what ever it is you wish; if you keep a strong sense of self
identity and don't get carried away, respect and honor your oracle,
you will enjoy a manifold reciprocation!
