<h1>About</h1>
	In 2005 or 2006 I recieved a copy of a DreamSpell calendar from our local food co-op in Olympia. This began quite an interesting journey as, being a computer programmer with a degree in English literature, I had finally found a "system" that could be used to help understand or explain with a model our life experience. 
	<P>
	I have always been interested in nature, numbers and colors.  I remember my favorite discussion durng a highschool English class, a substitute teacher brought a college-level lecture on the usage of color in The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald.  As my brother says, I have a "poetical" relationship with numbers. And while growing up, I wanted to be a Naturalist after being immersed and inspired by the wonderful children's books my parents provided.
	<P>
	This is a DreamSpell application for the Android, inspired and adapted from many resources, 
	primarily and materialy from Star Root's amazing DreamSpell Oracle. 
	
	Credit goes to all who have created and prepared the way 
	(I am quite positive this list is incomplete, but it is a start, 
	look for updates and/or please contact me if you wish to be listed):

	Regarding DreamSpell, Oracles and Divination

	"The Mayan DreamSpell calendar by Jose Arguelles is based on the Mayan Tzolkin." - Orion kin 66
	
	In the interest of full disclosure and in respect of openness, it is appropriate to provide the following links to quality critiques of the DreamSpell calendar system:

	</ul>
	
	I think it is worthwhile to digest this quote from the above "Fallacies" link:

	 For those who abandoned following Dreamspell, the reasons given are as follows (distilled from hundreds of email and letters since 1992): 1. Realized that it was not aligned with the Mayan day-count. 2. Believed they had been misled by the general claim or implication  that the Dreamspell system was the same as the Mayan calendar (clear disclosure of the truth was absent). 3. Detected a cultic displeasure when questions were raised during group meetings. 4. Personal experiences with the Dreamspell creator and/or inner circle that were unpleasant. 5. Felt they had been hypnotized.
