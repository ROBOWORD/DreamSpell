<h1>About</h1>
	This is a DreamSpell application for Android, adapted by Damien Joldersma (White Cosmic Dog,	 kin 130).
	I was greatly inspired by Starroot\'s Daily DreamSpell Oracle. And of course the Law of Time Foundation.
	And also StarShip Plaza, amazing.  I also used Photon.net\'s charts and resources.
